Here are some of the projects I completed during my Data Analyst course on Reskilling:

--> Sales Analysis Dashboard: Developed a comprehensive dashboard using Power BI to analyze sales data, including trends, 
top-selling products, and regional performance. Utilized DAX to create custom calculations for accurate insights.

--> Customer Segmentation Analysis: Conducted a thorough customer segmentation analysis using Python and SQL. 
Applied clustering algorithms to categorize customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographics, enabling targeted marketing strategies.

--> Predictive Modeling for Churn Prediction: Implemented a churn prediction model using machine learning techniques like logistic regression and decision trees. 
Utilized R programming language to preprocess data, build models, and evaluate their performance.

--> Financial Data Forecasting: Built a forecasting model in Excel to predict financial performance metrics such as revenue and expenses. 
Employed time series analysis techniques and advanced Excel functions to generate accurate forecasts for future periods.

--> Data Cleaning and Transformation: Performed extensive data cleaning and transformation tasks using Excel and SQL to prepare raw datasets for analysis. 
Applied techniques such as outlier detection, missing value imputation, and data normalization to ensure data integrity.


These projects showcase my proficiency in various data analysis tools and techniques acquired during the course, demonstrating my ability to derive meaningful insights and drive informed decision-making processes.
